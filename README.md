# Appetizers4Dayz
Appetizers4Dayz is a web application which creates and stores a database of appetizer recipes for users to search through. 
Users can interact with other users by finding cooking buddies, using an algorithm created by our team. They can also input, update,
and delete recipes using their account.

The application was developed using a HTML and CSS front end and a PHP and SQL backend. 
The database of recipes (appetizer name, ingredients, recipe steps) was populated using a python web scraper script.
